# Explain Code

The `explain_code` tool analyzes and explains code through a sequential thinking approach that builds understanding incrementally.

## Overview

This tool provides capabilities to:
- Analyze code through a flexible, multi-step thinking process
- Break down complex code into understandable components
- Build understanding progressively through numbered thoughts
- Allow for revisions and branching of thoughts as understanding deepens
- Support dynamic adjustment of thought depth based on code complexity
- Accept file paths or direct code content for analysis

## Sequential Thinking Approach

Like other sequential thinking tools in DocuMCP, the Explain Code tool:

1. Breaks down complex code analysis into logical reasoning steps
2. Builds understanding progressively through numbered thoughts
3. Allows for revising earlier thoughts when new insights emerge
4. Supports branching into alternative analysis paths
5. Provides visibility into the full reasoning process
6. Dynamically adjusts the number of steps based on complexity

| file | string | Yes | - | File path or direct code content to analyze |
| explanation | string | No | - | Current explanation (accumulates as thinking progresses) |
| thought | string | Yes | - | The current thinking step content |
| nextThoughtNeeded | boolean | Yes | - | Whether another thought step is needed |

## Example

**Request (Initial Thought)**:
```json
{
  "name": "explain_code",
  "arguments": {
    "file": "function calculateTotal(items) {\n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n}",
    "explanation": "",
    "thought": "Looking at this function calculateTotal, I see it takes an array parameter called 'items' and returns a value derived from a reduce operation. Let me analyze what it's doing step by step.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 5
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "file": "function calculateTotal(items) {\n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n}",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 1
}
```

**Request (Middle Thought)**:
```json
{
  "name": "explain_code",
  "arguments": {
    "file": "function calculateTotal(items) {\n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n}",
    "explanation": "The function calculateTotal iterates through an array of items to compute a total price.",
    "thought": "The reduce function is using each item's price and quantity properties. It multiplies them together and adds the result to an accumulator value, which starts at 0. This is a common pattern for calculating a total price from a collection of items, such as in a shopping cart.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 2,
    "totalThoughts": 5
  }
}
```

**Request (Revision Thought)**:
```json
{
  "name": "explain_code",
  "arguments": {
    "file": "function calculateTotal(items) {\n  return items.reduce((total, item) => {\n    return total + (item.price * item.quantity);\n  }, 0);\n}",
    "explanation": "The function calculateTotal iterates through an array of items to compute a total price. It uses the reduce method to sum up the price Ã— quantity for each item in the array.",
    "thought": "Looking more carefully at this function, I notice that it doesn't include any error handling. If items is null, undefined, or not an array, this function will throw an error. Similarly, if any item lacks price or quantity properties, it will result in NaN values.",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "thoughtNumber": 3,
    "totalThoughts": 5,
    "isRevision": true,
    "revisesThought": 1
  }
}
```

## File Input Flexibility

The `explain_code` tool offers flexibility in how you provide the code to analyze:

### File Path Input

You can provide a path to an existing file:

```json
{
  "file": "/path/to/source.js"
}
```

The tool will:
1. Check if the path exists
2. Load the file content automatically
3. Use that content for code explanation

### Direct Code Input

Alternatively, you can provide the code content directly:

```json
{
  "file": "function example() {\n  return 'Hello World';\n}"
}
```

The tool will detect that this is code content rather than a file path and use it directly.

## Implementation Details

The `CodeExplainer` is implemented in `/mcp/src/tools/ExplainCodeTool.ts` with these key features:

- **Thought History**: Maintains a record of all thinking steps
- **Branching Support**: Allows exploration of alternative explanations
- **Validation**: Ensures all required parameters are provided
- **File Path Detection**: Automatically loads file content when a valid path is provided
- **Formatting**: Visually formats thoughts for easier understanding in console output

```typescript
// Example implementation (simplified)
class CodeExplainer {
  thoughtHistory: any[] = [];
  branches: any = {};
  
  async validateThoughtData(input: any) {
    // Validate input data
    if (!data.file || typeof data.file !== "string") {
      throw new Error("Invalid file: must be a string");
    }
    
    // Check if file is a path or direct code content
    let fileContent = data.file;
    const fileExists = await filesystem.fileExists(filePath);
    if (fileExists) {
      // Load content from file
      const readResult = await filesystem.readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
      fileContent = readResult.data!.content;
    }
    
    return {
      file: fileContent,
      explanation: data.explanation || "",
      thought: data.thought,
      // Other properties...
    };
  }
  
  async explainCode(input: any) {
    const validatedInput = await this.validateThoughtData(input);
    
    // Process thought and maintain history
    this.thoughtHistory.push(validatedInput);
    
    // Handle branching and revisions
    if (validatedInput.branchFromThought && validatedInput.branchId) {
      // Store in branch history
    }
    
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify({
            file: validatedInput.file,
            thoughtNumber: validatedInput.thoughtNumber,
            totalThoughts: validatedInput.totalThoughts,
            nextThoughtNeeded: validatedInput.nextThoughtNeeded,
            branches: Object.keys(this.branches),
            thoughtHistoryLength: this.thoughtHistory.length,
          }, null, 2)
        }
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

## Code Analysis Process

The sequential thinking approach to code explanation typically follows these steps:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Understanding the overall structure and purpose of the code
2. **Component Identification**: Identifying key elements like functions, variables, and control structures
3. **Logic Analysis**: Examining how the components interact and what operations are performed
4. **Algorithmic Analysis**: Assessing the algorithm or approach used and its efficiency
5. **Edge Case Consideration**: Identifying potential limitations, edge cases, or assumptions
6. **Context Integration**: Connecting the code to the broader context where relevant
7. **Summarization**: Providing a concise, accurate explanation of the code's functionality

## Usage Patterns

The sequential thinking approach is particularly useful for:

1. **Complex Code**: When the code involves intricate logic or multiple operations
2. **Unfamiliar Patterns**: When encountering unusual or domain-specific code patterns
3. **Interdependent Components**: When code relies on multiple interrelated parts
4. **Algorithm Analysis**: When understanding the efficiency or approach of an algorithm
5. **Learning Purposes**: When needing to break down code for educational purposes
